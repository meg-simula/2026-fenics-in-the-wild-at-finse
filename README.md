# 2026 FEniCS in the Wild - Finse Hackathon

Collection of notes and code associated with the Feb 2-3 2026
Hackathon at Finse.

## Main goal

To create a video-based standalone visualization of from imaging to
finite element simulation.

## Next steps

[x] Decide on an example: use the In-silico molecular transport ... data
    and simulations

[ ] Map out the story: See STORY.md for the Storyboard

[ ] Figure out good way and workflow to modularize making the video,
    combining separate pieces

[ ] Figure out how to create overlay captions. Should I embed it in
    the video or use some tool to add it after?

[ ] Play with what to create myself, what to use genAI for.

[ ] Make the separate pieces

[ ] Work with Daniel about visualizing simulation results in Blender,
    Mon afternoon.

[ ] Prototype Premiere
