# 2026 FEniCS in the Wild - Finse Hackathon

Collection of notes and code associated with the Feb 2-3 2026
Hackathon at Finse.

## Main goal

To create a video-based standalone visualization of from imaging to
finite element simulation.

Side goal: Use vscode instead of emacs+terminal

## Next steps

[x] Decide on an example: use the In-silico molecular transport ... data
    and simulations

[/] Figure out good way and workflow to modularize making the video,
    combining separate pieces

[/] Map out the story: See STORY.md for the Storyboard

[/] Play with what to create myself, what to use genAI for.

[x] Made Gemini Gem for this Hackathon with info about myself (CV),
    and the causemann2025insilico.pdf (paper). 

[/] Try MoviePy.
    * sudo apt install python3-moviepy. Hm. Issues with imageio_ffmpeg. Stuck here and with flaky internet for some time.
    * Ok, try updating the environment.yml/conda instead. Oops, and then I did conda env update. Yay, that worked! Now, I can import moviepy. 
    * But, then there was an isue with ImageMagick. Commented out magic path line (sudo emacs /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml -nw). OK, now I can make a TextClip and CompositeClips. Yay!
    * Ok, prototype added scripts/movie_story/prototype_moviepy.py 
    
[ ] Figure out how to create overlay captions. Should I embed it in
    the video or use some tool to add it after? 

[ ] Make the separate pieces

[ ] Work with Daniel about visualizing simulation results in Blender,
    Mon afternoon.

[ ] Prototype Premiere

## What Gemini said

### Outline of story

Gemini provided a useful story outline (see separate Gem for more
details). Here are the main headings

| Time | Heading |
| 0:00 - 0:10 | The Input: From Scan to Surface
| 0:10 - 0:25 | The Pipeline: Mixed-Dimensional Construction
| 0:25 - 0:40 | The Physics: Flow Drivers
| 0:40 - 0:55 | The Simulation: Tracer Enrichment
| 0:55 - 1:10 | The Insight: Morphology Matters
| 1:10 - 1:25 | Conclusion & Future

### Pipeline to use

I asked about good tools to use, working within Python. Main recommendations:

* PyVista ("Since your data is likely in XDMF/HDF5 or VTK formats from
  FEniCS, PyVista is the best tool. It wraps the VTK library (which
  Paraview is built on) but provides a clean, Pythonic interface.")
* NiBabel/Matplotlib for the images
* MoviePy ("You can use MoviePy to script the video editing. Use it
  for: Stitching the frames generated by PyVista and Matplotlib into
  .mp4 files. Adding the text overlays, titles, and transitions you
  outlined in the storyboard. Combining clips (e.g., the split-screen
  comparison of Normal vs. Dilated PVS).")

**Note to self**: The MoviePy suggested semmed like a really good
  one. I'll start there.
