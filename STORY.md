# Personalized brain drug delivery: from MRI to 3D-1D modelling

## What is the story?

### Outline of sections

* Title 
* The data: subject-specific images (MR, ToF, QSM)
* From images to segmentation
* From segmentation to meshes
* From meshes to simulation
* From simulation to insights

#### The data: subject-specific images

* T1w: T1-weighted MRI -> 3D volumes including brain and CSF spaces
* Tof: Time of flight -> Arterial network
* QSM: -> Venous networks
